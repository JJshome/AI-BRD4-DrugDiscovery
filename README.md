# AI-based BRD4 Inhibitor Discovery

A comprehensive framework for developing novel BRD4 inhibitors using artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches. This repository implements methodologies described in a patent for efficiently identifying and optimizing drug candidates targeting BRD4 protein.

## Overview

BRD4 (Bromodomain-containing protein 4) is a key epigenetic reader that plays critical roles in various biological processes including gene transcription, DNA recombination, replication, and repair. Dysregulation of BRD4 has been implicated in multiple diseases, particularly cancer. This repository provides tools and workflows for developing BRD4 inhibitors through computational methods.
